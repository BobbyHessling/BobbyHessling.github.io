    "text": "The White Sox have been historically bad. If you removed every teams best season over the last 100 years, only the White Sox and Washington Nationals are the two Major League franchises who would have never won a PLAYOFF SERIES. Yes a playoff series. Outside of 2005 the next White Sox season where they won a playoff series was 1917, where the won the World Series.\n\nThis was the Kenny Williams Timeline over his years as the White Sox Gneral Manager and Vice President of Baseball Operations. It looks frustrating.\nThe White Sox need to get good, the best way to get good is rehaul, get young talent build a core and control them for a long period of time. Little did people know on July 23rd 2016 this would soon happen for the White Sox.\nEnter Chris Sale.\n\nChris Sale cutup uniforms. Yes, he cutup uniforms. The White Sox were planning on wearing their 1976 jerseys. Sale did not like that as they were uncomfortable. “Sale asked that they not wear (throwbacks) on his day because they are uncomfortable. Things escalated when they wouldn’t relent” - Ken Rosenthal on twitter.\nSale ended up being sent home and was traded to the Boston Red Sox on December 6th 2016. This begun the rebuild. Years of mediocrity for the White Sox and it was time to blow it up. Sale was traded for one of the best prospects, INF Yoan Moncada, RHP Michael Kopech, OF Luis Alexander Basabe, and RHP Victor Diaz.\nMoncada and Kopech were the prizes for the White Sox. The Sox didn’t stop there. They traded Adam Eaton to the Washington Nationals for RHP Lucas Giolito, RHP Reynaldo Lopez, and RHP Dane Dunning. Again highly regarded prospects.\nIn 2017 the White Sox traded LHP Jose Quintana to the Chicago Cubs for RHP Dylan Cease and OF Eloy Jimenez. Weeks later they traded 1B/3B Todd Frazier and RHP David Robertson to the New York Yankees for Blake Rutherford, Ian Clarkin, and Tito Polin. This traded ended up not panning out on either side.\nThe White Sox all of a sudden had 10 of MLB’s top 100 prospects\n\nThe White Sox have some real talent. Develop the guys correctly and the White Sox would be in good hands. They had one of the best farm systems in the MLB. They were with the Atlanta Braves who are highlighted in Red below and the San Diego Padres, highlighted in gold below. Here is how they panned out.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(wehoop)\n\nmlbgamescores2016 &lt;- read_csv(\"mlbgamescores2016.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2016)\n\nmlbgamescores2017 &lt;- read_csv(\"mlbgamescores2017.csv\") |&gt;

Peaking in 2020 and 2021 then falling like a rock in water. 2021 is the season where events take place that question this down fall, and why the White Sox couldn’t have been like the Braves who consistently get better and better.\nWas it Tony La Russa getting hired as the White Sox manager on October 29th 2020? Did he close the playoff window when he was hired? Its possible. La Russa was 76 years old when he was re-hired by the White Sox after he was fired in 1986 by Hawk Harelson. White Sox owner and chairman Jerry Reinsdorf always “regretted” the decision of firing La Russa. But lets not get ahead of ourselves.\nWhy did White Sox fans by into the hype? Well they jad every reason too, Yoan Moncada in 2019 was living up to his high expectations.\n\n\nCode\nhitters2019 &lt;- read_csv(\"hitters2019.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Name = gsub(\"*\",\"\", Name, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; mutate(Name = gsub(\"#\",\"\", Name, fixed=TRUE))\n\nwhitesoxhitters &lt;- hitters2019 |&gt; filter(Tm == \"CHW\")\n\nthirdbase2019 &lt;- hitters2019 |&gt; filter(\n  Position == \"*5\" |\n  Position == \"56\" |\n  Position == \"*5/DH\" |\n  Position == \"*5/H\" |\n  Position == \"*5/HD6\" |\n  Position == \"*5H/D4\" |\n  Position == \"*597/3DH\" |\n  Position == \"*5H4/37\" |\n  Position == \"*5/HD\" |\n  Position == \"*54/HD\" |\n  Position == \"*56/H\" |\n  Position == \"*5H\" |\n  Position == \"54/HD\" \n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data=thirdbase2019, aes(x=BatAvg, y=OPS)) +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=thirdbase2019, \n    aes(x=BatAvg, y=OPS, label=Name)\n  ) + \n  geom_rect(aes(xmin=.30, xmax=.318, ymin=0.9, ymax=1), fill=\"lightgreen\", alpha=.2) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=.309, y=1.01, label=\"The Box of Excellence\"), size=4, color=\"darkgreen\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Batting Average\", \n    y=\"OPS (On Base + Slugging\", \n    title=\"2019 Third Baseman\", \n    subtitle=\"Where 14 third baseman in 2019 stack up amongst each other\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Bobby Hessling\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop three third baseman in 2019 off of average and ops at age 24, yeah he’s going to be a superstar.

It was in right field from 2019-2021 apart of the Goose Island Beer Company, one of the official beer sponsors for the White Sox during that time. But following 2021 the White Sox switched to Miller as their official beer sponsor. Goodbye Goose, what happens after really makes you question did the goose have and impact.\nWhite Sox Home Record from 2019-2021: 110-81 (.575)\nWhite Sox Home Record from 2022-2023: 68-95 (.417)\nInterseting, there wasn’t a massive roster overhaul from 2021 to 2022 or 2023. Sure changes were made La Russa and the Sox parted ways but a significant decline? Even the overall record shows the drop off\n\n\nCode\nCWS1921 &lt;- whitesoxgame |&gt; filter(\n  Season == \"2019\" | \n  Season == \"2020\" | \n  Season == \"2021\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  group_by(Season, Tm) |&gt; arrange(Tm, Date) |&gt; filter(Wins == max(Wins) & Losses == max(Losses)) |&gt; mutate(WinPCT = Wins/(Wins + Losses)) |&gt; select(Tm, Season, WinPCT, Home, Away)\n\nCWS2223 &lt;- whitesoxgame |&gt; filter(\n  Season == \"2022\" |\n  Season == \"2023\"\n) |&gt; \n  group_by(Season, Tm) |&gt; arrange(Tm, Date) |&gt; filter(Wins == max(Wins) & Losses == max(Losses)) |&gt; mutate(WinPCT = Wins/(Wins + Losses)) |&gt; select(Tm, Season, WinPCT, Home, Away)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=CWS1921, aes(x=Season, weight=WinPCT), fill=\"black\") +  \n  geom_bar(data=CWS2223, aes(x=Season, weight=WinPCT), fill=\"grey\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    y=\"Season Win Percentage\",\n    title=\"The Goose head that was in right field, White Sox overall Record\", \n    subtitle=\"The goose head that was in Right field in 2019 to 2021 then the fall off with the White Sox \noverall record\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports-Reference.com | By Bobby Hessling\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis goose being removed may just be the reason. As silly as it sounds the number don’t lie. Sure it could be Jerry Reinsodrf botched the manager hire in 2020 and paid fro it in 2022, or Pedro Grifol can’t figure it out as a White Sox manager which makes all White Sox fans disappointed and can only think “What if.”\nWhat if Yoan stayed healthy and didn’t get covid? What if La Russa wan’t hired, What if the core stayed healthy/ What if the goose never was removed, or heck even added in the first place? We may never know. So all White Sox fans can do is look back to 2019-2021 and remember the fun, remember they hype. Remember the good memories.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_step(data=CWS2021, aes(x=Date, y=WinPCT, group=Tm)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept=as.Date(\"2021-06-15\")) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=as.Date(\"2021-04-14\"), y=.500), color=\"navy\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=as.Date(\"2021-04-12\"), y=.525, label=\"Rodon no-no\"), size=3, color=\"navy\") + \n  geom_point(aes(x=as.Date(\"2021-06-16\"), y=.632), color=\"#8FBCE6\") + \n  geom_text(aes(x=as.Date(\"2021-06-24\"), y=.647, label=\"1st in AL\"), size=3, color=\"#8FBCE6\") +\n  geom_point(aes(x=as.Date(\"2021-09-23\"), y=.565)) + \n  geom_text(aes(x=as.Date(\"2021-09-30\"), y=.610, label=\"Won the\nCentral\"), size=3) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=as.Date(\"2021-09-03\"), y=.577), color=\"royalblue\") + \n  geom_text(aes(x=as.Date(\"2021-09-03\"), y=.545, label=\"Bobby's final sox game\"), size=3, color=\"royalblue\") +\n  geom_point(aes(x=as.Date(\"2021-07-18\"), y=.608), color=\"orange\") + \n  geom_text(aes(x=as.Date(\"2021-07-18\"), y=.544, label=\"White Sox take 2 out of 3\nvs Astros, 1st in AL\"), size=3, color=\"darkorange\") +\n  geom_point(aes(x=as.Date(\"2021-08-27\"), y=.576), color=\"black\") + \n  geom_text(aes(x=as.Date(\"2021-09-06\"), y=.620, label=\"White Sox \nfully healthy\"), size=3, color=\"black\") +\n  geom_point(aes(x=as.Date(\"2021-08-12\"), y=.586), color=\"navy\") + \n  geom_text(aes(x=as.Date(\"2021-08-10\"), y=.635, label=\"Field of Dreams\nWalk off\"), size=3, color=\"navy\") +\n   geom_point(aes(x=as.Date(\"2021-07-13\"), y=.606), color=\"red\") + \n  geom_text(aes(x=as.Date(\"2021-07-13\"), y=.635, label=\"All Star Break\"), size=3, color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=as.Date(\"2021-07-10\"), y=.2, label=\"Sticky Substance Ban\"), color=\"black\") + \n  labs(\n    x=\"Date\", \n    y=\"White Sox Winning Percentage\", \n    title=\"2021 White Sox win percentage\", \n    subtitle=\"The chart of the White Sox win percentage throughout\nthe 2021 Season with special dates\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Bobby Hessling\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause all Sox fans feel like this\n\nOctober 12th 2021, Leury Garcia, Dylan Cease, Carlos Rodon, Lucas Giolito, Aaron Bummer, and Michael Kopech all look on with the rest of the Sox fans.
