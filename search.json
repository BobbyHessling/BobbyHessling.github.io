    "text": "The White Sox have been historically bad. If you removed every teams best season over the last 100 years, only the White Sox and Washington Nationals are the two Major League franchises who would have never won a PLAYOFF SERIES. Yes a playoof series. Outside of 2005 the next White Sox season where they won a playoff series was 1917, where the won the World Series.\n\nThis was the Kenny Williams Timeline over his years as the White Sox Gneral Manager and Vice President of Baseball Operations. It looks frustrating.\nThe White Sox need to get good, the best way to get good is rehaul, get young talent build a core and control them for a long period of time. Little did people know on July 23rd 2016 this would soon happen for the White Sox.\nEnter Chris Sale.\n\nChris Sale cutup uniforms. Yes, he cutup uniforms. The White Sox were planning on wearing their 1976 jerseys. Sale did not like that as they were uncomfortable. “Sale asked that they not wear (throwbacks) on his day because they are uncomfortable. Things escalated when they wouldn’t relent” - Ken Rosenthal on twitter.\nSale ended up being sent home and was traded to the Boston Red Sox on December 6th 2016. This begun the rebuild. Years of mediocrity for the White Sox and it was time to blow it up. Sale was traded for one of the best prospects, INF Yoan Moncada, RHP Michael Kopech, OF Luis Alexander Basabe, and RHP Victor Diaz.\nMoncada and Kopech were the prizes for the White Sox. The Sox didn’t stop there. They traded Adam Eaton to the Washington Nationals for RHP Lucas Giolito, RHP Reynaldo Lopez, and RHP Dane Dunning. Again highly regarded prospects.\nIn 2017 the White Sox traded LHP Jose Quintana to the Chicago Cubs for RHP Dylan Cease and OF Eloy Jimenez. Weeks later they traded 1B/3B Todd Frazier and RHP David Robertson to the New York Yankees for Blake Rutherford, Ian Clarkin, and Tito Polin. This traded ended up not panning out on either side.\nThe White Sox all of a sudden had 10 of MLB’s top 100 prospects\n\nThe White Sox have some real talent. Develop the guys correctly and the White Sox would be in good hands. They had one of the best farm systems in the MLB. They were with the Atlanta Braves who are highlighted in Red below and the San Diego Padres, highlighted in gold below. Here is how they panned out.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(wehoop)\n\nmlbgamescores2016 &lt;- read_csv(\"mlbgamescores2016.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2016)\n\nmlbgamescores2017 &lt;- read_csv(\"mlbgamescores2017.csv\") |&gt;

Peaking in 2020 and 2021 then falling like a rock in water. 2021 is the season where events take place that question this down fall, and why the White Sox couldn’t have been like the Braves who consistently get better and better.\nWas it Tony La Russa getting hired as the White Sox manager on October 29th 2020? Did he close the playoff window when he was hired? Its possible. La Russa was 76 years old when he was re-hired by the White Sox after he was fired in 1986 by Hawk Harelson. White Sox owner and chairman Jerry Reinsdorf always “regretted” the decision of firing La Russa. But lets not get ahead of ourselves.\nFirst lets mention 2020. The White Sox begin the season with an unknown in a Covid shortened season. They had added one of the best catchers in Baseball Yasmani Grandal. The biggest question mark was the pitching for the White Sox, even after the addition of Dallas Keuchel. The offense was there, but the pitching be good enough.\n\n\nCode\nwhitesoxgame &lt;- mlbgamelogs |&gt; \n  group_by(Season, Tm) |&gt; \n  filter(Tm == \"CHW\") |&gt; \n  mutate(WinPCT = Wins/(Wins + Losses)) |&gt; \n  select(Tm, Season, WinPCT, Home, Away, Wins, Losses, Date)\n\nCWS2020 &lt;- whitesoxgame |&gt; filter(Season == \"2020\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_step(data=CWS2020, aes(x=Date, y=WinPCT, group=Tm)) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=as.Date(\"2020-08-31\"), y=.628), color=\"#002B5C\") + \n  geom_text(aes(x=as.Date(\"2020-08-28\"), y=.645, label=\"1st in AL Cent\"), size=3, color=\"#002B5C\") +\n  geom_point(aes(x=as.Date(\"2020-08-09\"), y=.500), color=\"black\") + \n  geom_text(aes(x=as.Date(\"2020-08-09\"), y=.420, label=\"On Sunday Night baseball\nfor first time since 2013\"), size=3, color=\"black\") +\n  geom_point(aes(x=as.Date(\"2020-08-21\"), y=.592), color=\"#0E3386\") + \n  geom_text(aes(x=as.Date(\"2020-08-17\"), y=.610, label=\"Sox hit 6 home runs\noff the Cubs\"), size=3, color=\"#0E3386\") +\n  geom_point(aes(x=as.Date(\"2020-09-06\"), y=.634), color=\"royalblue\") + \n  geom_text(aes(x=as.Date(\"2020-09-06\"), y=.653, label=\"Sox 2nd in AL\"), size=3, color=\"royalblue\") +\n  geom_point(aes(x=as.Date(\"2020-09-17\"), y=.660), color=\"black\") + \n  geom_text(aes(x=as.Date(\"2020-09-17\"), y=.703, label=\"White Sox clinch first playoff \nbid since 2008, Best record in AL\"), size=3, color=\"black\") +\n  geom_point(aes(x=as.Date(\"2020-09-21\"), y=.629), color=\"#134A8E\") + \n  geom_text(aes(x=as.Date(\"2020-09-16\"), y=.610, label=\"Sox Divsion Choke\"), size=3, color=\"#134A8E\") +\n  geom_point(aes(x=as.Date(\"2020-08-26\"), y=.612), color=\"black\") + \n  geom_text(aes(x=as.Date(\"2020-08-31\"), y=.585, label=\"Lucas Giolito No-No\"), size=3, color=\"black\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of August the White Sox were the best team in the AL Central. This point in the season, Sox fans hadn’t seen that since 2012, where they choked the division away, which ended up happening. The White Sox clinched their first post season bid since 2008. It had been 12 years.\nThe White Sox were also first in the American League. Was this real life? It was.\nBut it’s not all sunshine and rainbows.\nThe White Sox lost 2 out of 3 to the Cincinnati Reds, didn’t seem too bad. The White Sox had a massive four game series against the Cleveland Indians. The White Sox lost all of them. Two walks off’s bullpen collapses.\nIn 7 days the White Sox went from the top spot in the American League and a three game advantage in the Central, to the 4th spot in the American League and 2nd in the central. Absolute heartbreak and frustration.\nPlayoff baseball and the White Sox ended up as the 7th seed in the American League Playoff bracket. They had a date with the Oakland Athletics in the AL Wild Card Round.\nThe White Sox took Game 1 over the A’s inside the Coliseum. Lucas Giolito went 7 Innings, allowed 2 hits, 1 run which was earned and struck out 8 batters while he was perfect through the first 6 innings.\nThe White Sox ended up losing Game 2, and Game 3 was a total meltdown.\nThe White Sox jumped out in-fornt 3-0 but poor bullpen management using nine pitchers, yes NINE pitchers in game 3. With Carlos Rodon blowing the lead in the 5th inning. The White Sox never scored again. Their season was over.\nThere were bright spots in the season. Jose Abreu was the MVP, Luis Robert looked great, Dallas Keuchel looked great, Lucas Giolito showed flashes, Eloy looked good it was all coming together.\n\n\nCode\nhitters2020 &lt;- read_csv(\"hitters2020.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Name = gsub(\"*\",\"\", Name, fixed=TRUE)) |&gt; mutate(Name = gsub(\"#\",\"\", Name, fixed=TRUE))\n\n\nRows: 696 Columns: 31\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (5): Name, Tm, Lg, Pos Summary, Name-additional\ndbl (26): Rk, Age, G, PA, AB, R, H, 2B, 3B, HR, RBI, SB, CS, BB, SO, BatAvg,...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCode\ngoodhitters2020 &lt;- hitters2020 |&gt; filter(G &gt; 45 & BatAvg &gt; 0.250)\n\nwhitesoxhitters2020 &lt;- goodhitters2020 |&gt; filter(Tm == \"CHW\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    data=goodhitters2020, \n    aes(x=BatAvg, y=OPS), color=\"grey\"\n    ) +\n geom_point(\n    data=whitesoxhitters2020,\n    aes(x=BatAvg, y=OPS), color=\"black\"\n  ) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.30) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.80, color=\"darkgreen\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.85, color=\"green\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=whitesoxhitters2020, \n    aes(x=BatAvg, y=OPS, label=Name)\n  ) + \n  geom_text(aes(x=.245, y=.868, label=\"Good OBP\"), size=3, color=\"green\") +\n   geom_text(aes(x=.251, y=.815, label=\"Above Average OBP\"), size=3, color=\"darkgreen\") +\n   geom_rect(aes(xmin=.300, xmax=.375, ymin=0.9, ymax=1.2), fill=\"lightgreen\", alpha=.2) +\n  geom_text(aes(x=.338, y=1.23, label=\"MVP Players\"), size=4, color=\"darkgreen\") +geom_point(aes(x=.341, y=1.102), color=\"#005A9C\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=.327, y=1.12, label=\"Freddie Freeman \n2020 NL MVP\"), size=3.5, color=\"#005A9C\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Batting Average\", \n    y=\"OPS (On Base + Slugging\", \n    title=\"All 2020 Major League Hitters\", \n    subtitle=\"White Sox hitters amongst all of the MLB where rank in batting average and OPS\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Bobby Hessling\"\n    ) +\ntheme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nrbi2020 &lt;- goodhitters2020 |&gt; select(Tm, Name, RBI) |&gt;\n  filter(RBI &gt; 41) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(RBI)) \n\nrbi2020 |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    RBI = \"RBI\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"2020 MLB RBI Season Leaders\",\n    subtitle = \"Jose Abreu led all of the Majors in RBI's in 2020\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Bobby Hessling  |  **Source:** MLB Sports Reference\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2020 MLB RBI Season Leaders\n\n\nJose Abreu led all of the Majors in RBI's in 2020\n\n\nTm\nName\nRBI\n\n\n\n\nCHW\nJosé Abreu\n60\n\n\nATL\nMarcell Ozuna\n56\n\n\nATL\nFreddie Freeman\n53\n\n\nNYY\nLuke Voit\n52\n\n\nSDP\nManny Machado\n47\n\n\nCLE\nJosé Ramírez\n46\n\n\nLAA\nMike Trout\n46\n\n\nSDP\nFernando Tatis Jr.\n45\n\n\nBOS\nRafael Devers\n43\n\n\nCOL\nCharlie Blackmon\n42\n\n\nMIN\nEddie Rosario\n42\n\n\nNYM\nDominic Smith\n42\n\n\nHOU\nKyle Tucker\n42\n\n\n\nBy: Bobby Hessling | Source: MLB Sports Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJose Abreu led the MLB in runs driven in, it helped in the Cubs series at Wrigley that he had 9 RBI’s in 3 games.\nWhite Sox still needed to address certain needs.
